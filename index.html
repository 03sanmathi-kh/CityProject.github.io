# 🌆 Vishalnagari – City Planning Project

Welcome to the official project website of **Vishalnagari**, designed as part of the **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)** coursework.

This project applies **BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s Shortest Path, Greedy Methods**, and other algorithms to plan and manage a fully functional smart city.

## 🧠 Algorithms Used
We used:

- **BFS** for exploring city sectors  
- **DFS** for depth-based planning  
- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** for shortest routes  
- **Greedy Algorithms** for optimal resource allocation
